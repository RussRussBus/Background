##Log of What I did

#5/19/25
- Since chip_seq.py seems to be working well as a reads generator, I made a shell script that creates reads at varying coverages both with 0 peaks in back and foreground (unbiased)
	- this is ```run_diff_coverages.sh```store in ```Kenta_Stuff/Scripts/```
- I ran the shell script and seems to be working well
= the FASTAs created by the various coverage experiments are stored in ```Generated_Data/Different_Coverages_Unbiased```
